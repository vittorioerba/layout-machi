## About this fork

I made this personal fork to add some manual alternatives to the interactive switcher of the original repo.
I unpacked the function `machi.switcher.start()` into:
- `machi.manual_switcher.move(client, direction)`: moves `client` in `direction`, respecting the current machi layout;
- `machi.manual_switcher.resize_topleft(client, direction)`: resizes `client` in `direction` by stretching from the top-left corner;
- `machi.manual_switcher.resize_bottomright(client, direction)`: resizes `client` in `direction` by stretching from the bottom.right corner.
This allows to create custom keybindings to reorganize the clients manually.

**CAUTION:** I'm not familiar with Lua, with the original source code and with Awesome wm. Use this at your own risk.


## Why?

TL;DR --- I want the control of my layout.

1. Dynamic tiling is an overkill, since tiling is only useful for persistent windows, and people extensively use hibernate/sleep these days.
2. I don't want to have all windows moving around whenever a new window shows up.
3. I want to have a flexible layout such that I can quickly adjust to whatever I need.

## Compatibilities

I developed it with Awesome 4.3.
Please let me know if it does not work in other versions.

## Really quick usage

See `rc.patch` for adding layout-machi to the default 4.3 config.

## Quick usage

Suppose this git is checked out at `~/.config/awesome/layout-machi`

Use `local machi = require("layout-machi")` to load the module.

The package provide a default layout `machi.default_layout` and editor `machi.default_editor`, which can be added into the layout list.

The package comes with the icon for `layoutbox`, which can be set with the following statement (after a theme has been loaded):

`require("beautiful").layout_machi = machi.get_icon()`

By default, any machi layout will use the layout command from `machi.layout.default_cmd`, which is initialized as `dw66.` (see interpretation below).
You can change it after loading the module.

## Use the layout

Use `local layout = machi.layout.create(args)` to instantiate the layout with an editor object. `args` is a table of arguments, where the followings can be used:

  - `name`: the constant name of the layout.
  - `name_func`: a `function(t)` closure that returns a string for tag `t`. `name_func` overrides `name`.
  - `persistent`: whether to keep a history of the command for the layout. The default is `true`.
  - `default_cmd`: the command to use if there is no persistent history for this layout.
  - `editor`: the editor used for the layout. The default is `machi.default_editor` (or `machi.editor.default_editor`).

Either `name` or `name_func` must be set - others are optional.

The function is compatible with the previous `machi.layout.create(name, editor, default_cmd)` calls.

## The layout editor and commands

### Starting editor in lua

Call `local editor = machi.editor.create()` to create an editor.
To edit the layout `l` on screen `s`, call `editor.start_interactive(s = awful.screen.focused(), l = awful.layout.get(s))`.

### Basic usage

The editing command starts with the open region of the entire workarea, perform "operations" to split the current region into multiple sub-regions, then recursively edits each of them (by default, the maximum split depth is 2).
The layout is defined by a sequence of operations as a layout command.
The layout editor allows users to interactively input their commands and shows the resulting layouts on screen, with the following auxiliary functions:

1. `Up`/`Down`: restore to the history command
2. `Backspace`: undo the last command.
3. `Escape`: exit the editor without saving the layout.
4. `Enter`: when all regions are defined, hit enter will save the layout.

### Layout command

As aforementioned, command a sequence of operations.
There are three kinds of operations:

1. Operations taking argument string and parsed as multiple numbers.

   `h` horizontally split, `v` vertically split, `w` grid split, `d` draft split

2. Operations taking argument string as a single number.

   `s` shift active region, `t` set the maximum split depth

3. Operation not taking argument.

   `.` finish all regions, `-` finish the current region, `/` remove the current region, `;` no-op

Argument strings are composed of numbers and `,`. If the string contains `,`, it will be used to split argument into multiple numbers.
Otherwise, each digit in the string will be treated as a separated number in type 1 ops.

Each operation may take argument string either from before (such as `22w`) or after (such as `w22`).
When any ambiguity arises, operation before always take the argument after. So `h11v` is interpreted as `h11` and `v`.

For examples:

`h-v`

```
11 22
11 22
11
11 33
11 33
```


`hvv` (or `22w`)

```
11 33
11 33

22 44
22 44
```


`131h2v-12v`

Details:

 - `131h`: horizontally split the initial region (entire desktop) to the ratio of 1:3:1
 - For the first `1` part:
   - `2v`: vertically split the region to the ratio of 2:1
 - `-`: skip the editing of the middle `3` part
 - For the right `1` part:
   - `12v`: split the right part vertically to the ratio of 1:2

Tada!

### Advanced grid layout

__More document coming soon. For now there is only a running example.__

Simple grid, `w44`:
```
0 1 2 3

4 5 6 7

8 9 A B

C D E F
```

Merge grid from the top-left corner, size 3x1, `w4431`:
```
0-0-0 1

2 3 4 5

6 7 8 9

A B C D
```

Another merge, size 1x3, `w443113`:
```
0-0-0 1
      |
2 3 4 1
      |
5 6 7 1

8 9 A B
```

Another merge, size 1x3, `w44311313`:
```

```

### Draft mode

__This mode is experimental. Its usage may change fast.__

Unlike the original machi layout, where a window fits in a single region, draft mode allows window to span across multiple regions.
Each tiled window is associated with a upper-left region (ULR) and a bottom-right region (BRR).
The geometry of the window is from the upper-left corner of the ULR to the bottom-right corner of the BRR.

This is suppose to work with regions produced with `d` or `w` operation.
To enable draft mode in a layout, configure the layout with a command with a leading `d`, for example, `d12210121`, or `dw66`.

### Persistent history

By default, the last 100 command sequences are stored in `.cache/awesome/history_machi`.
To change that, please refer to `editor.lua`. (XXX more documents)

## Switcher

Calling `machi.switcher.start()` will create a switcher supporting the following keys:

 - Arrow keys: move focus into other regions by the direction.
 - `Shift` + arrow keys: move the focused window to other regions by the direction. In draft mode, move the window while preserving its size.
 - `Control`[ + `Shift`] + arrow keys: move the bottom-right (or top-left window if `Shift` is pressed) region of the focused window by direction. Only works in draft mode.
 - `Tab`: switch beteen windows covering the current regions.

So far, the key binding is not configurable. One has to modify the source code to change it.

## Caveats

1. layout-machi handles `beautiful.useless_gap` slightly differently.

2. True transparency is required. Otherwise switcher and editor will block the clients.
